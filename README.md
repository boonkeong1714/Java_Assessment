**Reflection Questions:**  
*1. What did you like about this project?*  
I can use what I learned in Java to create/modify real application.


*2. What did you struggle with in this project?*  
 - OOP is like spider web: classes, objects, attributes and methods are intertwined together
 - need to find a good way to name all classes and methods
 - Java modifier is confusing, don't know when to use which one: public? private? static? void?
 - Reading someone else's code is challenging, need to figure out why the code is written in this way

  
*3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?*  
 - PLEASE, please go through the potential solution after this assessment! don't waste this valuable thinking process
 - have better explaination of what we are suppose to do: there are a lot of unused methods in the code
